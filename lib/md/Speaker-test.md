First Step
----------

First you need to get a list of all your sound cards (if you have
multiple ones) and on each card you may have multiple devices ( for
example a set of output for analog and one digital output and one HDMI)

Type  : ( L should be upper case )

    aplay -L

you will get the list of the devices and sub devices configured on your
system. You will have lines similar to :

    surround51:CARD=Live,DEV=0
    SBLive! Value [CT4670], ADC Capture/Standard PCM Playback
    5.1 Surround output to Front, Center, Rear and Subwoofer speakers

that is one way of output to that specific card and device.

now in order to test the specific card and device type commands like:

    speaker-test -Dsurround51:Live -c6 -twav

or you can use something like this ` `

    mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=Live.0  /1.mp3 -af channels=6:2:0:1:0:2

this means:

    mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw="Audio Card"."Audio Device"  "Filename to play" -af channels=6:"Number of routings":"Routing1":"Routing2"...

and Routing1 can be: "Channel 0 of original" to "Channel 1 of output"
and Routing1 can be: "Channel 0 of original" to "Channel 2 of output"
(Same output on both channels ( mono ) ) (and the outputs are on two
different physical plugs on the sound card)

    -c6 will tell speaker test to product 6 channel audio.

I test this output:

    surround71:CARD=HDMI
    HDA ATI HDMI
    7.1 Surround output to Front, Center, Side, Rear and Woofer speaker

with this code:

    speaker-test -surround71:HDMI -c8 -twav

Just stereo sound from one stereo jack
--------------------------------------

    speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2

A 4 speaker setup from two stereo jacks
---------------------------------------

    speaker-test -Dplug:surround40 -c4

A 5.1 speaker setup from three stereo jacks
-------------------------------------------

    speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6

    speaker-test -Dsurround40 -c6 -twav

2-speaker test using the spdif (coax or optical) output
-------------------------------------------------------

    speaker-test -Dplug:spdif -c2
