This is a Markdown conversion of the old MediaWiki based system at http://alsa.opensrc.org.
Feel free to fork and send pull requests for content updates or bugs and suggestions via
the issue tracker. Any assistance with manually fine tuning the crudely mass converted
pages or suggestions with this Github based system would be appreciated.

If you have ALSA audio problems then the best thing you could do is to download the `alsa-info`
script at the link below and run it (which will offer to upload the output to alsa-project.org)
and sign up to the `alsa-user` mailing-list with a description of your problem with error
messages and a link to the uploaded info.
